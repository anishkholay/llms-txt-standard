# llms.txt - The Standard for AI Model Interaction with Websites

## Overview
'llms.txt' is a proposed standard that allows website owners to define how Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with their content. Unlike 'robots.txt', which controls web crawlers, 'llms.txt' helps AI models understand and utilize website content in a structured way.

## Why Use 'llms.txt'?
- **Enhance AI Readability** â€“ Provide structured summaries for AI models.
- **Improve Content Discovery** â€“ Help LLMs understand key sections of your website.
- **Maintain Control** â€“ Communicate which parts of your site should be indexed or ignored by AI.

## How to Implement 'llms.txt'
1. **Create a 'llms.txt' file** in your website's root directory.
2. **Define structured content** that provides a clear overview of key pages and sections.
3. **Upload the file** to your server so it can be accessed at 'https://yourwebsite.com/llms.txt'.
